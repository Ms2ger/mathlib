# IMO 1969 Q1

Prove that there are infinitely many natural numbers $a$ with the following property:
the number $z = n^4 + a$ is not prime for any natural number $n$.

The key to the solution is that you can factor $z$ into the product of two polynomials,
if $a = 4*m^4$. This is Sophie Germain's identity, called `pow_four_add_four_mul_pow_four`
in mathlib.

lemma factorization {m n : ℤ} : ((n - m)^2 + m^2) * ((n + m)^2 + m^2) = n^4 + 4*m^4 :=
pow_four_add_four_mul_pow_four.symm

/-!
To show that the product is not prime, we need to show each of the factors is at least 2,
which `nlinarith` can solve since they are expressed as a sum of squares.
-/
lemma left_factor_large {m : ℤ} (n : ℤ) (h : 1 < m) : 1 < ((n - m)^2 + m^2) := by nlinarith
lemma right_factor_large {m : ℤ} (n : ℤ) (h : 1 < m) : 1 < ((n + m)^2 + m^2) := by nlinarith

/-!
The factorization is over the integers, but we need the nonprimality over the natural numbers.

Should this be in src? Probably, with assumptions 1 < a.nat_abs and 1 < b.nat_abs.

/-!
Now we just need to show this works for an arbitrarily large $a$, to prove there are
infinitely many of them.
$a = 4*(2+b)^4$ should do. So $m = 2+b$.
-/

/-- `good_nats` is the set of natural numbers satisfying the
condition in the problem statement, namely the `a : ℕ` such that `n^4 + a` is not prime
for any `n : ℕ`. -/

/--
The function $a = 4*(2+b)^4$.
-/
def a (b : ℕ) : ℕ := 4*(2+b)^4

You should be able to prove that this is strict_mono (hence, injective) using dot-syntax lemmas. If not, this is a good reason to add more of them.
-/

lemma a_good (b : ℕ) : a b ∈ good_nats :=
polynomial_not_prime (show 1 < 2+b, by linarith)

/-
A good lemma for src/ (not_congr finite_image_iff): if f : α → β is inj_on s, then f '' s is an infinite set iff s is an infinite set. Related lemmas:

    if f is inj_on s and s is infinite and maps_to f s t, then t is infinite (above + monotonicity);
    if f is injective and [infinite α], then range f is an infinite set;
    if f is injective, [infinite α] and ∀ x, f x ∈ s, then s is an infinite set (this is what's I'd use in this problem).

/-- We conclude by using `a` to get a contradiction with the assumption that `good_nats` is
a `fintype`, since the elements of a `fintype` must have a maximal element. -/
